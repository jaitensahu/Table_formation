Made table by the table tag and set its border as 2px, the cellpadding attribute as 4 to give space between the content and cell and the used rules attribute to show border between all lines and columns
then used the thead tag for the header section of the table and the th tag to put heading of the table.

Used the tbody tag for the body section of the table and the tr tag for giving no. rows and the td tag table data. Also used image tag img nested in td so that we can get an image in the cell
similarly used anchor tag a nested in the td tag to get hyperlink
